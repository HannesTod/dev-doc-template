# 8 Appendix

??? info
    The final section of your document will contain a list of references that will benefit the reader.

    Here are some elements you should include, according to CNCF’s TAG Security:

    * Known issues over time  
      List or summarize statistics of past vulnerabilities with links. If none have been reported, provide data, if any, about your track record in catching issues in code review or automated testing.
    * OpenSSF best practices  
      A brief discussion of where the project is at with respect to OpenSSF best practices and what it would need to achieve the badge.
    * Case studies  
      Provide context for reviewers by detailing 2-3 scenarios of real-world use cases.
    * Related projects/vendors  
      Reflect on times prospective users have asked about the differences between your project and another similar solution. Reviewers may have the same question, so you can give a brief explanation here.

    Again, you can add any information you like here to aid the reader. If you’ve incorporated the OpenSSF Scorecard to your project, this would be a great place to let your stakeholders know where they can find your score.
