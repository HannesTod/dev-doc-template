# 6 Secure Development Practices

??? info "Summary statement"
    This section has three values. After providing the summary statement, weâ€™ll nest the other two values beneath subheadings, with narrative explanations for each section.

    Secure development practices overview

    * Development pipeline (SDLC, provenance, etc.)
    * Communication channels (community, collaboration, etc.)

## 6.1 Development Pipeline

??? info
    What security practices do you automate or enforce in your SDLC?

    Here are some things you might consider including:

    * Do you have branch protection or repo security features in place?
    * Are committers required to sign their commits, or a contributor license agreement?
    * Do you have automated testing or fuzzing on every pull request?
    * Do you have software composition analysis or dependency management tooling?
    * How many reviewers are required for a pull request to be approved?
    * Do you have any measures around code owners?
    * Is your release process automated?
    * Does every release include an automatically generated Software Bill of Materials?
    * Do you sign releases?
    * Are container images immutable and signed?

## 6.2 Communication Channels

??? info
    This section should paint a picture of how the project communicates. Use the following sections to document things like Slack channels, recurring meetings, mailing lists, and so forth.

    * Internal  
      How do team members communicate with each other?
    * Inbound
