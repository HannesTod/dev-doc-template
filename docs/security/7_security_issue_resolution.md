# 7 Security Issue Resolution

??? info
    Security issue resolution encompasses both responsible disclosure and incident response.

    At the top of this section, give users a quick link to where they can find your official security policy (probably a SECURITY.md at the repos top-level). We will expand on this through the next subsections. The security policy should include the currently supported versions and a manual on how to report a vulnerability.

## 7.1 Responsible Disclosure Practice

??? info
    Your project should have a process through which a responsible user or researcher can disclose findings related to vulnerabilities or weaknesses in your project, and the process a project will take in the event that a report is received or another security incident occurs.

    If you’re using GitHub, there is a built-in feature for this within the Security tab at the top of your repository page. If you’re using another strategy, detail your approach here.

    Include a reference to where your project has documentation letting readers know how to make responsible disclosures for your project.

## 7.2 Incident Response

??? info
    A major part of secure software development is simply a matter of planning ahead for when things go wrong. Vulnerabilities and weaknesses will eventually be found, and proper planning will enable your project to quickly and effectively respond.

    Use this section to document your project’s process for triage, confirmation, notification of vulnerability or security incident, and patching/update availability.

    If your project lacks a comprehensive plan for incident response, then include as much detail as you can—and be sure to include this gap on your project’s roadmap!
