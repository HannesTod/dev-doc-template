# 5 Project Compliance

??? info

    Is your project already compliant with some regulatory standard, such as PCI-DSS, COBIT, ISO, GDPR, or others? That knowledge will help focus a lot of the review audit efforts later.

    If the answer is yes, include a list of what standards the project is compliant with, and how that compliance has been validated.

    If the answer is no, leave a note regarding why that is the case. Is the tooling not intended for use in regulated settings? Have you not gotten that far into your development yet? Will it need to be compliant in the future? Leave notes here accordingly.
