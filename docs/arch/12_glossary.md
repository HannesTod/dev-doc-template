# 12 Glossary

??? info
    **Content**

    The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use when discussing the system.

    You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in a multi-language environment (i.e. in offshore development models).

    **Motivation**

    You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

    * have an identical understanding of these termes
    * do not use synonyms and homonyms

    **Form**

    * A simple table with columns <Term> and <Definition>
    * Potentially more columns for translations

    | Term | Definition |
    | __Term-1__ | __definition-1__ |
    | __Term-2__ | __definition-2__ |

    **Examples**

    * Example Glossary: HTML Sanity Checker (Tabular)
