**arc42 makes documentation efficient and effective**

arc42 has a clear, simple and effective structure to document and communicate your software system. It is optimized for understandability and adequacy. arc42 naturally guides you to explain any kind of architecture information or decision in an understandable way, easy to maintain.
Painless documentationPermalink

arc42 users like the understandability, that mainly results from its standardized structure.

But what they really love is the manageable effort it takes to create and maintain arc42-based architecture documentation. We call it “painless documentation”, using the arc42 template does not require additional effort:

* You only describe things that your stakeholders really have to know.
* You explain facts and issues that are necessary to understand the system or individual design decisions.
* You only keep track of important architecture decision that you had to make anyhow.
